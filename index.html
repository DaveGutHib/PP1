    <p>In August of 1982 the Commodore 64 launched and took the world by storm.</p>

<p>An amazing middle ground between the ludicriously expensive full personal computers
    of the time, and single-function home gaming consoles like Pong.</p>

<p>The Commodore 64 allowed users to play a variety of games via magnetic casette tape,
    as well as write code and program their own games in the BASIC language.</p>

<p>For an example lets listen to the original theme song to the arcade version of Commando, released by Capcom in arcades in 1985</p>

<p>Then for comparison here is the Commodore 64 version of Commando by Rob Hubbard

<p>Even though it is considerably less powerful than an arcade machine, the C64's highly regarded sound chip allows for what feels
like considerably more complexity and depth to the music.</p> 

<p>This music is visualised in an Oscilloscope so you can see each of the three different sound channels at work</p>
