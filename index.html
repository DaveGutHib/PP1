    <p>Most of gaming history from the early 1980s are all centralised to one country: Japan
        Mario, Donkey Kong, Pac-Man, Galaxian and Space Invaders were all developed there and exported to the rest
        of the world.</p>

    <p>Since Nintendo, the granddaddy of Japanese gamings first home console: The Nintendo Entertainment System
        (NES), was not widely released nor
        popular in Europe AND since the Commodore 64 itself wasn't popular in Japan; these two factors combined make
        it as
        if there's are alternative unconnected reality that exists in gaming history.</p>

    <p>The US and Japan had their 8-bit home gaming consoles, the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and the Sega
        Mastersystem
        These realities would all get consolidated together in the early 1990s when the Super Nintendo and the Sega
        Megadrive would rise to
        global domination; </p>


    <p>In August of 1982 the Commodore 64 launched and took the world by storm.</p>

    <p>An amazing middle ground between the ludicriously expensive full personal computers
        of the time, and cartridge home consoles like the Atari 2600</p>

    <p>One of its main selling points, and part of it's namesake was the 64 Kilobytes of RAM it contained.
        This was incredibly powerful compared to it's contemporaries of the day, but considering that a modern
        phone, the iPhone Pro 13 has 6 million
        kilobytes of RAM, even something that was lauded in it's day is 94 thousand times LESS powerful than devices
        we now carry around in our pockets.
    </p>

    <p> Another of its primary points of appeal was its price. It retailed in America at $595, which might seem like
        a lot, but one of its closest competitors was
        the original IBM PC, which retailed at $1,565! The IBM PC it should also be noted only had 16KB of RAM!</p>

    <p> Doing a conversion to euro for those prices feels little inaccurate, since we're discussing events from so
        long ago, the euro currency did not exist at the time, but assuming it did with the same exchange rate as
        2022, it would be €560 for the Commodore and €1491 for the IBM PC </p>

    <p> If you think those prices are ridiculous, with inflation taken into account, in modern money the Commodore
        would retail for $1840/€1730 and the IBM PC for $4830/€4544</p>

    <p>The Commodore 64 allowed users to play a variety of games via magnetic cassette tape,
        as well as write code and program their own games in the BASIC language.</p>

        <h3>Fun fact:</h3>
        <p>All copies of The Great Giana Sisters were removed from sale and never saw a rerelease.
            It is believed this was to placate Nintendo, who attempted to take the creators to court!
