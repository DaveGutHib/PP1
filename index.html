    <p>In August of 1982 the Commodore 64 launched and took the world by storm.</p>

<p>An amazing middle ground between the ludicriously expensive full personal computers
    of the time, and single-function home gaming consoles like Pong.</p>

    <p>One of its main selling points, and part of it's namesake was the 64 Kilobytes of RAM it contained.
        This was incredibly powerful compared to it's contemporaries of the day, but considering that a modern phone, the iPhone Pro 13 has 6 million
        kilobytes of RAM, even something that was lauded in it's day is 94 thousand times LESS powerful than devices we now carry around in our pockets.
    </p>

    <p> Another of its primary points of appeal was its price. It retailed in America at $595, which might seem like a lot, but one of its closest competitors was
        the original IBM PC, which retailed at $1,565! The IBM PC it should also be noted only had 16KB of RAM!</p>

        <p> Doing a conversion to euro for those prices feels little inaccurate, since we're discussing events from so long ago, the euro currency did not exist at the time, but assuming it did with the same exchange rate as 2022, it would be €560 for the Commodore and €1491 for the IBM PC </p>

        <p> If you think those prices are ridiculous, with inflation taken into account, in modern money the Commodore would retail for $1840/€1730 and the IBM PC for $4830/€4544</p>

<p>The Commodore 64 allowed users to play a variety of games via magnetic casette tape,
    as well as write code and program their own games in the BASIC language.</p>
