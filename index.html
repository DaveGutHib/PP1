    <p>In August of 1982 the Commodore 64 launched and took the world by storm.</p>

<p>An amazing middle ground between the ludicriously expensive full personal computers
    of the time, and single-function home gaming consoles like Pong.</p>

<p>The Commodore 64 allowed users to play a variety of games via magnetic casette tape,
    as well as write code and program their own games in the BASIC language.</p>
