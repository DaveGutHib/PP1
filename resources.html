<p>For an example lets listen to the original theme song to the arcade version of Commando, released by Capcom in arcades in 1985</p>

<p>Then for comparison here is the Commodore 64 version of Commando by Rob Hubbard

<p>Even though it is considerably less powerful than an arcade machine, the C64's highly regarded sound chip allows for what feels

<p>This music is visualised in an Oscilloscope so you can see each of the three different sound channels at work</p>

Mario, Donkey Kong, Pac-Man, Galaxian and Space Invaders were all developed there and exported to the rest of the world.</p>

<p>As a result most of gamings most famous composers are also Japanese: Koji Kondo, Nobuo Uematsu, Yoko Shimomura and Yuzo Koshiro to name but a few</p>

<p>Since Nintendo, the granddaddy of Japanese gamings first home console: The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), was not widely released nor
popular in Europe AND since the Commodore 64 itself wasn't popular in Japan; these two factors combined make it as
if there's are alternative unconnected reality that exists in gaming history.</p>

<p>The US and Japan had their 8-bit home gaming consoles, the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and the Sega Mastersystem
These realities would all get consolidated together in the early 1990s when the Super Nintendo and the Sega Megadrive would rise to
global domination; </p>
