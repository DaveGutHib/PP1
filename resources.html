    <p>When I first revisted Commodore 64 music as an adult, it was with embarrased hands-wringing thinking it was<br>
    "Good for the time" and "Not actually comparable to famous Arcade music of the day like Street Fighter 2"</p>

    <p>But this was an inaccuracy on my part. The Commodore 64 launched in 1982, and Street Fighter 2 came out in 1991,<br>
    that's nearly a full decade, or a console generation and a half. It was obviously never going to be fair to compare<br>
    things of clearly different eras, but since the C64 is older than I am, I had just assumed that everything that<br>
    existed when I was a child were contemporaries of each other. </p>

    <p> When comparing the C64 to arcade games of the early 80s, I was genuinely shocked to realise that while the<br>
        graphics were obviously inferior, since the arcade hardware was more powerful, the C64 music absolutely blows<br>
        the arcade music out of the water. How could this be possible?</p>




<p>For an example lets listen to the original theme song to the arcade version of Commando, released by Capcom in 1985</p>

<figure>
    <figcaption>Commando (Arcade):</figcaption>
<audio src="\assets\media\Commando-(Arcade)-Main-Theme-Music.mp3" controls loop></audio>
</figure>
<p>Now lets listen to the music of the C64 port, released that same year</p>
<figure>

</figure>


<p>Even though the hardware is considerably less powerful than an arcade machine, it sounds better. How is this possible?</p>

<h2>Let's talk about sound chips</h2>
<p>Computer audio sound chips have a set number of audio channels available, or voices.<br>
Similar to how a human voice cannot sing a melody and a harmony at the same time, computer<br>
audio channels have a similar restriction.<br>
The number of channels limits how many simultaneous noises a sound chip can produce.<br>
Some computer audio chips took it a step further, and allowed each channel to only produce a single kind of noise.<br>
There are four kinds of soundwaves that could be produced by hardware of the day:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Square: High pitched beeps for melodies</li>
    <li>Triangle: Low pitched beeps for basslines</li>
    <li>Sawtooth: Pulsing beeps with a click to approximate drums</li>
    <li>Noise: Sound of audio static. Often used for lighter percussion instruments and ambient crowd noises.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Lets look at how one of the contemporaries of the day had it's sound channels set up.</h3>

<figure>
    <figcaption>Nintendo Entertainment System Sound Channels:</figcaption>
    <img src="\assets\images\Sound_voices_NES.png"></img>
</figure>

<p>As you can see the first two channels are solely dedicated to the square waves, the third to triangle,<br>
and the fourth to noise. These channels could produce these and only these sounds. If a composer wished to<br>
compose a song using 3 or 4 square wave sounds, this was not possible. Also note there is no channel for<br>
sawtooth so the NES could not produce this sound at all. <br>
Though not strictly relevant to this topic, the fifth "PCM sample" channel on the NES was used for sampling,<br>
or snippets of real world voices or music. But because this was incredibly storage space intensive on the small<br>
size cartridges of the day, it was rarely used.</p>

<h3>The C64's sound chip</h3>

<p>Known as the Sound Interface Device, or SID, it allowed for what feels like considerably more complexity<br> 
and depth to the music. As well as distinctive "synth" flavour to the sounds. Even though it only had three<br>
sound channels.</p>

<p>How did it do it?</p>

<figure>

<p>Most of gaming history from the early 1980s are all centralised to one country: Japan
Mario, Donkey Kong, Pac-Man, Galaxian and Space Invaders were all developed there and exported to the rest of the world.</p>

<p>As a result most of gamings most famous composers are also Japanese: Koji Kondo, Nobuo Uematsu, Yoko Shimomura and Yuzo Koshiro to name but a few</p>

<p>Since Nintendo, the granddaddy of Japanese gamings first home console: The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), was not widely released nor
popular in Europe AND since the Commodore 64 itself wasn't popular in Japan; these two factors combined make it as
if there's are alternative unconnected reality that exists in gaming history.</p>

<p>The US and Japan had their 8-bit home gaming consoles, the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and the Sega Mastersystem
These realities would all get consolidated together in the early 1990s when the Super Nintendo and the Sega Megadrive would rise to
global domination; </p>
